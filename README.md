# tools
---
I first started using LLM tools a couple of years ago when I attended a course by Every on using ChatGPT - How to Build an AI Chatbot which used GPT-4.  Later I went onto work at Microsoft in the AI/ML team supporting Enterprise customers.
I like many use ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini.  I have also used Deepseek, Qwen and other Open Source Models.  I had long desired to reproduce some of the app I use on the web which are unfortunately commonly bogged down behind cookies / advertising but essentially simple.
Recently inspired by [Useful patterns for building HTML tools](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/html-tools/) by Simon Willison.
I too have taken up the gauntlet of HTML + Javascript tools, via LLMs and otherwise to suit my individual work and tastes.

Data formatting workbench with real-time conversion, visual table synchronization, and a persistent theme engine for documentation workflows. The page lets you paste raw data (Tabs, CSV, or multi-space) and instantly transforms it into clean Markdown tables with custom column alignment and H3 title support. It includes a live rendered preview to verify formatting, automated row/column counters for data integrity, and one-click export options (copy to clipboard or download as .md file) to streamline documentation and README creation.

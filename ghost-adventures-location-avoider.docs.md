Ghost Adventures investigation locations with fast search, country/state filtering, and an “avoid list” builder for travel planning. The page lets you browse places by country → state/region → city and site name, toggle between fuzzy substring matching and “exact-ish” full-word matching, and add any result to a persistent personal blacklist stored in localStorage. It also includes a quick destination checker to warn you if a city, region, or landmark you’re considering appears in the dataset, plus one-click export options (copy to clipboard or download as CSV) for use while booking accommodation.
